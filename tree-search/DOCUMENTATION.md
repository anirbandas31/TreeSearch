# Search Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

For this task, we use the BFS algorithm. BFS is suitable because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that we find the shallowest duplicate first.

### Time Complexity:
 O(n): Each node is processed once.
### Space Complexity:
O(n): The queue and map can each hold up to n nodes in the worst case

## How to run
- run the following command in terminal `go run main.go`
- test it using command `go test ./...`
